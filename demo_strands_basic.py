STRANDS AGENT DEMO - Custom Tools & Built-in Tools Integration
=============================================================================

This demo showcases how to create an AI agent using the Strands framework with:
- Built-in tools from the strands-tools package (calculator, current_time)
- A custom tool defined as a Python function (letter_counter)

The agent can handle multiple requests in a single conversation, automatically
selecting and using the appropriate tools to answer questions about:
- Current time
- Mathematical calculations
- Letter counting in words

This example demonstrates the flexibility of combining pre-built and custom
tools to create a versatile AI agent.
